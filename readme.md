Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms
● Implement Supervised Learning algorithms K-NearestNeighbour and Random Forest
● Implement Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
● Implement K-Means Clustering
● Implement Evaluation measure Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Within cluster Sum of squares

● Using the Scikit-learn library, implement supervised learning algorithms SVM, Logistic
Regression, Decision tree, KNN
● Using the Scikit-learn library create an ensemble model using the voting classifier of the
above-mentioned algorithm.
● Create visualization using Matplotlib library, of the confusion matrix for each of the 5
classifiers (including the ensemble).

## random forest not implemented 
## KNN ( normalize data column wise which we missed here )
## use of matplot lib is very minimum
